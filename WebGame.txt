*Thoughts:
	At first I thought this game would be a breeze. I was wrong. This type of game requires me to build a good engine, about which I have zero experience. The large map introduces performance issues. And who will design the map? There are tools out there, but I haven't used any of them before. Time is not an issue if I have motivation. I can learn them all in a week if I really want to. Tbh, what I want is this year to end already.
